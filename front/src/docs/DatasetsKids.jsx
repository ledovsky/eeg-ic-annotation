      <DocsParagraph>Dataset was obtained from 20 typically developing children. The auditory odd-ball paradigm was applied during EEG recording where the standard stimulus was short 1000Hz signal (80%), and deviant stimuli were 1020Hz (10%) and 980Hz (10%). The duration of the signal was 50 ms and the interstimulus interval was 400ms.</DocsParagraph>
      <DocsHeader>Preprocessing</DocsHeader>
      <DocsParagraph>Obtained data were filtered (0.1 - 40 Hz) and divided into epochs (-500; 800 s) where noisy epochs were removed by threshold (350 mV). Only first 650 epochs were used for posterior ICA decomposition (FASTICA) with resampling on the level of 250 Hz. Final data consisted of 30 ICA components and uploaded into ALICE. All preprocessing steps were done using MNE Python package.</DocsParagraph>
